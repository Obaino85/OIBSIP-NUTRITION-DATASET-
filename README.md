This project involves analyzing a dataset containing **retail sales information** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The objective is to uncover meaningful **patterns**, **trends**, and **insights** that can empower retail business stakeholders to make better, data-driven decisions.

   ## Key Concepts and Challenges:

-  *Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.

-  *Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).

-  *Visualization: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.

-  *Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.
